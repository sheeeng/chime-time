# Context & Instructions

## Project Overview

Chime Time is a React and TypeScript web application that displays an
animated digital clock with configurable audio chimes. An Express
server provides a backend NTP synchronization endpoint. The Vite
development server is embedded in the Express application, so a single
`npm run dev` command starts everything.

## Architecture

- `server.ts` is the application entry point. It starts an Express
  server on port 3000, exposes a `/api/ntp` endpoint that queries an
  NTP server over UDP, and in development mode embeds the Vite
  middleware for hot module replacement.
- `src/App.tsx` contains the entire front end: clock display, chime
  logic, NTP offset calculation, and the settings footer.
- `src/main.tsx` mounts the React application.
- `index.html` is the Vite HTML template.
- `vite.config.ts` configures the Vite bundler and React plugin.
- `justfile` wraps common `npm` commands for convenience.

## Technology Stack

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS version 4
- Vite 8 for bundling
- Express 5 for the development and production server
- motion/react for animations
- lucide-react for icons
- tsx for running TypeScript in Node.js without a compile step
- esbuild for bundling the server for production

## Development Workflow

Run all commands from the repository root.

Install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

Start the development server.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Type-check without emitting files.

```shell
npm run lint
```

Build for production.

```shell
npm run build
```

Preview the production build.

```shell
npm run preview
```

Remove build artifacts.

```shell
npm run clean
```

## Writing Style

- Ensure adherence to Chicago Manual of Style by maintaining correct
  grammar and using proper punctuation in all comments and
  documentation.
- Follow Chicago Manual of Style capitalization conventions.
    - Use title case, or headline style, for headings, titles, and
      section names.
    - Use sentence case, or sentence style, for regular comments,
      descriptions, and explanatory text.
    - Always capitalize proper nouns regardless of context.
- Apply accurate grammar and proper punctuation throughout code
  documentation.
- For title case, apply these Chicago Manual of Style rules.
    - Always capitalize the first and last words.
    - Capitalize all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
    - Lowercase articles such as a, an, the.
    - Lowercase coordinating conjunctions such as and, but, or, for,
      nor, so, yet.
    - Lowercase prepositions such as at, by, for, from, in, into, of,
      on, to, with, between, through.
    - Lowercase "to" in infinitives such as to run, to see, to build.
    - Exception: Capitalize prepositions when used adverbially or
      adjectivally, such as "Look Up" and "Turn Down," or in verb
      phrases.
    - Do not use normal dashes `-` or em dashes `—`.
    - Do not use parentheses `()` to phrase terms.
    - Do not use abbreviated or slang terms; use full terms. Example:
        - Do not use `can't`; use `cannot`.
        - Do not use `config`; use `configuration`.
        - Do not use `docs`; use `documents`.
        - Do not use `info`; use `information`.
- Use indicative or imperative verbs. Example:
    - Indicative: "This function installs the package.", "The script
      configures the settings.", "The process runs the command."
    - Imperative: "Install the package.", "Configure the settings.",
      "Run the command."
    - Prefer imperative for instructions and documentation.
    - Prefer indicative for comments that explain what code does.
